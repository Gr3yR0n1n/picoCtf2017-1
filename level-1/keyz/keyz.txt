You need to generate public and private keys. using:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
(Dont put password and etc.)

This will create pair: id_rsa(private key)  id_rsa.pub(public key)

Then you need to do the follwing on the web-shell:
mkdir .ssh
cd .ssh/
touch authorized_keys

Then you copy the content of "id_rsa.pub" to the file authorized_keys.

This allow you to login remotely to the server using:
ssh username@site_url
