You need to give a number that when shifted right 4 times (divided by 16),
	will give you the address of win (0x0804852b)
	
0x0804852b<<4 = 0x804852B0 = 2152223408

But, it is too big for int number.
So you must use negative number: 
0x0FFFFFFF-0x0804852b = 0x07FB7AD4
0x07FB7AD4 << 4 = 0x7FB7AD40

The address is: -0x7FB7AD40 = -2142743872
