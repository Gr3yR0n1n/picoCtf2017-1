Open wireshark.
In the menu: File->Export Objects->Http.
This will export every page and image from the stream.

Note: If the page is shown more then once in the stream it will export it multiple times.
	  To avoid that use this unix command:
		 ls | grep ")" | awk '{print "rm ",$0}' | sed 's/(/\\(/g' |  sed 's/)/\\)/g' | sh

All the images are broken and In addition the logo and 4 other images are note exported.

Use the follwing filter to watch all the http GET request:
http.request.method == "GET"

And this one for the missing 4 pictures (look in the folder secret):
http.request.method == "GET" and http.request.full_uri contains "secret"

After you have the 4 pics you just need to make them one big pic (look in the folder flag).
In doing so you will find the flag:
953c5041c35bfebdf8625c3d517daa65

Note: To download or fix pics by hand, do the following:
Right cilck on http Get request.
In the menu pick: Follow-> TCP stream.
Then in the new window change "show saved data as" to Raw.
Copy the data (Starts in the third blue row) and make file out of it.
(You can use http://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_file.php?lang=en to do so)
