I used ans.py to find challange with prime factors all below 700.
(Because i had time restrictions)
Then i used the fact that:
- s1 is the sign of m1
- s2 is the sign of m2
So (s1*s2)mod N must be the sign of m1*m2.

Which means i had to sign all its factors and multiply them all.
And i found the flag (6298123dbccaf021eed3c55c79a806a3)
